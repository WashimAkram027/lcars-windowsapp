To-do list for LCARS functionality. Pick and choose tasks. Please put your name next to the task you are working on and resubmit to GitHub.
If any other ideas come up, please add them to this list and publish back to GitHub.

1.) Implement "return" button to file browser. This will be a copy-paste of the "file-system-button" HTML code to a new button named "return"
placed somewhere close to the file browser, allowing for the user returning directly back to the file home page

Assigned:

2.) Implement file management to the file browser. This includes both file adding and deleting, as well as being able to move files to different
folders.

Assigned:

3.) Add functionality to the "LCARS online" element to properly display whether the internet connection is online or offline. Currently, the
connection screen on the home page only works once. A solution would be to call the "refresh" button's function each time the user opens
another page.

Assigned:

4.) Re-color the elements on the file system browser to better match the LCARS theme. If you need help, reference the home page at the top
of the file. There, some basic documentation exists to how the different elements work.

Assigned:

5.) Add a proper startup animation/screen fitting the LCARS theme upon startup. VS code can read gifs and images in the respective folder.
For assistance, reference the "home" page and how it handles the "home-screen-splash-screen-placeholder" (function at line 335, function call
at line 482).

Assigned:

6.) Network interface on the home page displays a green checkmark, despite not being connected to the internet. This is a bug that needs to be fixed.

Assigned:

7.) implement a terminal for extra brownie points
